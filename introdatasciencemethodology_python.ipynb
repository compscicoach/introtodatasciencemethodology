    "![datasciencemethodologyflowchart.png](img/datasciencemethodologyflowchart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in data science methodology is to ask a question in which data science can be used to solve it. Don't get caught up in the tools themselves or the data first.Data science methodology begins with spending the time to seek clarification, by asking clarifying questions to attain what can be referred to as a business understanding, then you determine which data will be used to answer the core question.\n",

    "## Step 1: Business Understanding (The Business Problem: What is the Question I am trying to solve in which applying data science methodology will help to answer?)\n",
    "\n",
    "I am Dan the data scientist and my boss Mr. Washington has asked me to solve the following business problem: What gender has purchased more vehicles this year? Is there a specific make/model of vehicle preferred by gender to target a campaign? Are there specific features preferred most?\n",
    "\n",
    "To Clarify I ask Mr. Washington these clarifying questions: Do you hope to increase profitability of a certain model? overall profitability? He tells me he wishes to potentially replace an underperforming model and provide recommendations to the customer based on preferences.He wants to know what is the view of his business\n",
    "## Step 2: Analytic Approach (Choosing the right Machine Learning Algorithm Used to Solve)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the factors affecting the choice of a model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether the model meets the business goals\n",
    "- How much pre processing the model needs\n",
    "- How accurate the model is\n",
    "- How explainable the model is\n",
    "- How fast the model is: How long does it take to build a model, and how long does the model take to make predictions.\n",
    "- How scalable the model is\n",
    "- How complex the model is(more features needed to learn & predict, more complex feature engineering, & computational   overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Questions & Regression(Statistical Modeling) or Classification approach to obtaining the answer)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression(Relationship) Sample Question: Is there a relationship between time spent under sun and plant height?    \n",
    "      Y = f(x) \n",
    "   -  Y is plant height  \n",
    "   -  f is any model representative of the relationship \n",
    "   <br> \n",
    "   -  x is time plant spent in sun         \n",
    "   <br>     \n",
    "- Classification Yes/No Sample Question: Which animal is in a given image?           \n",
    "      Y = f(x)\n",
    "  -  Y is {dog, cat, horse, other}\n",
    "  -  f represents any model that captures the relationship\n",
    "      <br>\n",
    " -  x would be images encoded into tabular form     \n",
    "    <br>         \n",
    "- Regression(Prediction) Sample Question: What factors best predict electricity demand?\n",
    "       Y =f(x)\n",
    "       \n",
    "   -  Y = quantity of electricity demanded\n",
    "       <br>\n",
    "   - f any model capturing relationship between your data and electricity demanded\n",

    "## Step 4: Data Science Tools chosen based on Step 1,2,3 above__\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Factors to consider:    \n",
    "      <br>     \n",
    "      - Type of data I am analyzing: Unstructured, Structured, Semi-structured\n",
    "       <br>    \n",
    "      - Language best suited for data: R, SQL, Python  \n",
    "      <br>    \n",
    "      - Depending on the type of question you seek to answer will dictate method used e.g. data aggregation (preprocessing/prep of raw) vs. data wrangling(prep during analysis/model building   \n",
    "      <br>        \n",
    "      - Visualizations you'd like    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Locate the data you will use for analysis into Python(Data Collection)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note the following: \n",
    "- For the purpose of this exercise we've already generated fake data(Mockaroo) stored in this Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- __We will now illustrate how to locate & read a JSON data file(semi-structured) you want to use for analysis using the Python code below__\n",
    "- __For the purpose of this notebook illustration I only use data from one source but normally data aggregation is a step in the process, which takes multiple data sources consolidates into one location for analysis__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Importing the libs & data to Python for analysis (Data Understanding - Iterative)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two core libraries used for data analysis in Python: \n",
    "- the pandas library essential to data analysis & used for advanced data manipulation, stores data in dataframe\n",
    "- the NumPy library for scientific computing, mathematical operations stores data in N dimensional arrays(1D,2D,3D)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate both, first importing our python libraries used for data analysis then importing our data into Python for data analysis via the code below \n",
